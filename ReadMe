This is how I will review some of my coding skills before returning to UChicago.

I would like to both improve my C, Python, and R coding skills. I will work a little each day on each of these languages to hone the skills

Additionally, I need to practice with Git some more in order to ensure it comes smoothly to more

I will add sample code, test git commands, and maybe even add some notes to the repository
